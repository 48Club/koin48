Virtual Blockchain - The virtual blockchain that only exist on Telegram
Virtual Coin ("Koin48") - the coin that resides in telegram only, name is subject to change
Physical Token ("Token") - The Ether token that resides on ether network, which is a reflection of the virtual chain
BNB48 Group ("Community")
BNB48 Group Member ("Member")




Virtual Blockchain
	- Participation in the community is considered "Mining"
	- One Block is created and mined every 10 Minutes
	- Total “Koin48” creation in every 100,000 minutes is 19,100
		- 14,100 reward to miner
		- 5,000 reward to a distribution wallet
	- A public fund wallet that keeps all fees charged (usage of this wallet is unknown)
	- Auto-adjust difficulty to keep 80% mining rate
	- Each miner has a chance per block to receive the reward
	- Reward also includes half of the transaction fees accumulated up to this point
	- The other half of accumulated fees goes into public fund wallet
	- Additional 0.5 “Koin48” is sent to the distribution wallet
	- Un-mined block goes into the bench holder
	- If there is no bench holder, the block is lost


Telegram to Ether Network
	- "Koin48" is initially acquired on the virtual blockchain
	- User may bind telegram id into an ether wallet address
	- A central gateway ("Gateway") connects the virtual blockchain and Ether Network
	- User has the ability to withdraw "Koin48" into Ether Network
	- Upon withdraw, the "Koin48" left on virtual Network becomes "Locked" and thus not transferable
	- Upon withdraw, "Gateway" will transfer "Token" from the Creation Wallet into "Member" wallet
	- “Token” in “Member” wallet is transferable.  
	- Periodically (TBD), "Gateway" will take snapshot on the Ether Network to update locked "Koin48" on virtual blockchain
	- Rights within telegram community align with total “Virtual Coin” owned
	- Rights on the physical network align with total “Token” owned.

Distribution
	- “Token” starts with a Creation Wallet
	- Only “Token” outside of creation wallet bear rights
	- "Token" tracks wallet balance of each "Member" (physical only)
	- Third party tokens can be dropped into the "Token" address
	- "Token" may start a distribution period, and a snapshot is taken
	- During distribution Period, each member may send 0 "Token" into the "Token" address to receive the distribution, proportionally to the snapshot

Issues to consider
	- "Token" is associated with an admin wallet (Internal Control required)
	- A voting system is required to set the admin wallet for "Token"
	- Consider multiple admin wallets?
	- Member who lose private key to Ether wallet
	- Member who lose Access to Telegram account
